This moves data and log files written by `Kingfisher Collect <https://kingfisher-collect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to an AWS S3 Bucket, after they have been loaded into `Kingfisher Process <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

The data is archived in case we need to re-load it in future.
